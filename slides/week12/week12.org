* Random Variables and Probability Distributions

- What is a random variable? We assigns a number to an event
     - coin flip: tail= 0; heads= 1
     - Senate election: Ted Cruz= 0; Beto O'Rourke= 1
     - Voting: vote = 1; not vote = 0

Probability distribution: Probability of an event that a random variable takes a certain value


* Random Variables and Probability Distributions

- P(coin =1); P(coin = 0)
- P(election = 1); P(election = 0)


* Random Variables and Probability Distributions

- *Probability density function (PDF)*: f(x) How likely does X take a particular value?
- *Probability mass function (PMF)*: When X is discrete, f(x)=P(X =x)

#+BEAMER: \pause

- *Cumulative distribution function (CDF)*: F(x) = P(X $\leq$ x)
       - What is the probability that a random variable X takes a value equal to or less than x?
       - Area under the density curve (either we use the sum $\Sigma$ or integral $\int$)
       - Non-decreasing


* Random Variables and Probability Distributions: Binomial Distribution

- *PMF*: for $x \in \{0, 1, \dots, n\}$,
    $f(x) \ = \ P(X = x) \ = \ {n \choose x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$

- *PMF* function to tell us: what is the probability of x /successes/ given n trials with with P(x) = p

#+BEAMER: \pause

In /R/:
#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :session
dbinom(x = 2, size = 4, prob = 0.1) ## prob of 2 successes in 4 trials with p =0.1
#+end_src




* Random Variables and Probability Distributions: Binomial Distribution

- *CDF*: for $x \in \{0, 1, \dots, n\}$
    $F(x) \ = \ P(X \le x) \ = \ \sum_{k = 0}^x {n\choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$

- *CDF* function to tell us: what is the probability of /x or fewer/ /successes/ given n trials with with P(x) = p

#+BEAMER: \pause

In /R/:
#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :session
pbinom(2, size = 4, prob = 0.1) ## prob of 2 or fewer successes in 4 trials with p =0.1

* PMF and CDF

CDF of F(x) is equal to the sum of the results from calculating the PMF for all values smaller and equal to x

#+BEAMER: \pause


In /R/:
#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :session
pbinom(2, size = 4, prob = 0.1) ## CDF

sum(dbinom(c(0,1,2),4,0.1)) ## summing up the pdfs
#+end_src

* Random Variables and Probability Distributions: Binomial Distribution

- Example: flip a fair coin 3 times

    $f(x) \ = \ P(X = x) \ = \ {n \choose x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$

    $f(x) \ = \ P(X = 1) \ = \ {3 \choose 1} 0.5^1 (0.5)^{2} = 3*0.5*0.5^2 = 0.375$

[[~/Documents/GitHub/Polisci209_2018/slides/week11/gauss.jpeg]]


* Normal distribution

- Takes on values from -$\infty$ to $\infty$
- Defined by two things: $\mu$ and $\sigma^{2}$
              - Mean and Variance (standard deviation squared)


- Mean defines the location of the distribution
- Variance defines the spread



* Random Variables and Probability Distributions: Normal Distribution


 *Normal distribution* with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$
 - *PDF*:
   $f(x) \ = \ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma}\exp\left(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$

* Random Variables and Probability Distributions: Normal Distribution


 - *CDF* (no simple formula. use \R{} to compute it):
   $F(x) \ = \ P(X \le x) \ = \ \int_{-\infty}^x
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\exp\left(-\frac{(t - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) dt$

* Normal distribution

- Normal distribution is symmetric around the mean
- Mean = Median

* Random Variables and Probability Distributions: Normal Distribution

Let $X \sim N(\mu,\,\sigma^{2})$, and c be some constant

- Adding/subtracting to/from a random variable that is normally distributed also results in a variable with a normal distribution:
  Z = X + c then $Z \sim N(\mu +c,\,\sigma^{2})$

#+BEAMER: \pause


- Multiplying or dividing a random variable that is normally distributed also results in a variable with a normal distribution:
 $Z = X\times c$ then $Z  \sim N(\mu \times c,\,(\sigma \times c)^{2})$

- Z-score of a random variable that is normally distributed has mean 0 and sd = 1


* Random Variables and Probability Distributions: Normal Distribution

Curve of the standard normal distribution:

- Symmetric around 0
- Total area under the curve is 100%
- Area between -1 and 1 is ~68%

* Random Variables

/Expectations/, /Means/, and /Variances/

For probability distributions, means should not be confused with /sample means/

Expectations or means of a random variable have specific meanings for its the probability distribution


* Means and Expectation

A sample mean varies from sample to sample

Mean of a probability distribution is a theoretical construct and constant

#+BEAMER: \pause

Example: Age of undergraduate body at A&M

* Means and Expectation

The expectation of a random variable is equal to the sum of all possibilities /weighted/ by the probabilities

#+BEAMER: \pause

Example: expectation of rolling one die

$\E(X)$ = $\frac{1}{6} \times 1 + \frac{1}{6} \times 2 + \frac{1}{6} \times 3 + \frac{1}{6} \times 4 \frac{1}{6} \times 5 \frac{1}{6} \times 6 = 3.5$



* Means and Expectation

The expectation of a random variable is equal to the sum of all possibilities /weighted/ by the probabilities

\begin{equation*}
     \E(X) \ = \ \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
                          \sum_{x} x\ f(x)
                          & \textsf{if } X \ \textsf{is discrete} \\
                          \int x\ f(x) dx & \textsf{if } X \ \textsf{is continuous}
                        \end{array}\right.
\end{equation*}

* Means and Expectation

Remember the lottery!

Expected value: winnings $\times$ p(winning) + 0 $\times$ p(not winning)


* Means and Expectation

What is $\E(X)$ for the number of heads in 100 coin flips?

#+BEAMER: \pause

$\E(X) = 0.5\times 1 + 0.5\times 1+ ... + 0.5\times 1 = 0.5*100 = 50$

* Variance

- Variance is standard deviation squared

- Variance in a probability distribution indicates how much uncertainty exists

- Similar *but not the same* as sample standard deviation

* Variance

Population variance: $\V(X) \ = \ \E[\{X - \E(X)\}^2] \ = \ \E(X^2) - \{\E(X)\}^2$
