* Survey Sampling

- A sample is a small share of the population in that we are interested in

#+BEAMER: \pause

- How do we draw samples in such a way that polls accurately reflect what is going to happen?

- How to construct samples that will represent the population?

* Survey Sampling

- Example: We want to know the voting intentions of Texans (or Americans)
- We can hardly ask all eligible voters about their intention

#+BEAMER: \pause
- We take a /sample/

* Survey Sampling

- The size of the sample is less important than its composition

- Never trust an internet poll

* Literary Digest Sample

- Mail questionnaire to 10 million people

- Addresses came from phone books and club memberships

- Problems?

#+BEAMER: \pause

- Biased /sample/


* Quota Samping

- Sample certain groups until quota is filled

- Does not mean unobservables are representative

* Simple Random Sampling

- Think of all voters sitting in a box, survey firm randomly draws voters

- Random draws without replacement give us an unbiased estimate of the population

- Everybody has the same chance of being in the sample


* Simple Random Sampling

- Pre-determined number of units are randomly selected from population

- Sample will be representative of population on observed and unobserved characteristics



* Simple Random Sampling

- Not every single sample will be exactly representative

- If we were to take a lot of random samples (say 1000 samples of 1000 respondents), on average the samples would be representative

* Simple Random Sampling

- Each single sample can be off and different

- Polls are associated with uncertainty

* Random Sampling is hard

- How to create sampling frame?

- Random digit dialing? Walking to random houses?

- Multi-stage cluster sampling

* Non-reponse bias

- Unit non-response bias:

* Non-reponse bias

- Item non-response bias:
   /What was the last crime you committed?/
- Sensitive questions: non-response, social desirability bias
  /Turnout/, /racial prejudice/, /corruption/


* Why could this be a problem in the Afghanistan example?

/Taliban supporters may be less likely to answer questions about Taliban/

#+BEAMER: \pause
- social desirability bias:
#+BEAMER: \pause

* Summarizing Bivariate Relationships

- Bivariate relationships are associations between *two* variables
- Example: treatment of Spanish confederates (X or T) and exclusionary attitudes (Y)

* Simple Summaries of Bivariate Relationships

If X (independent variable) is categorical:
- Comparison of means
- boxplots

* Simple Summaries of Bivariate Relationships

If both X (independent variable) and Y (dependent variable) are continuous:

* Simple Summaries of Bivariate Relationships: Scatterplot

- Direct graphical comparison of two variables

- Use plot(y,x) in /R/

* What do we do with skewed variables?


#+BEAMER: \pause
- When variable have a small number of observations with extremely large or small positive values, we often take the natural log
- The natural logarithm is the logarithm with base e, which is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.7182 (inverse of $e^{y}$)

* Bivariate Relationships in Numbers

- How can we quantify the relationship between two continuous variables?

#+BEAMER: \pause
- Correlation: the most used measure of bivariate relationships
- Correlation measures how two variables move together relative to their respective means.

* Calculating correlations -- Step 1: Standardizing a variable

- By standardizing we bring all variables on the same scale
- The resulting mean will be zero, the standard deviation will be one
- We standardize by subtracting a variables mean and dividing by the standard deviation

* Calculating correlations -- Step 1: Standardizing a variable

- Standardized variables are also called z-scores:
$z_{i} = \frac{x_{i} - \bar{x} \text{(mean of x)}}{sd_{x} \text{(standard deviation of x)}}$

- The z-score is independent of the scale of the variable or shifts in the variable
#+BEAMER: \pause

- This means GDP and (GDP*100 + 10000) will have the exact same z-scores

* Calculating correlations -- Step 2: Calculating the correlation

Correlation (x,y) $= \frac{1}{N} \sum^{N}_{i=1}$ z-score of $x_i \times$ z-score of $y_{i}$

#+BEAMER: \pause

Correlation (x,y) $= \frac{1}{N} \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{x_{i} - \bar{x}}{sd_{x}} \times   \frac{y_{i} - \bar{y}}{sd_{y}}$

* Calculating correlations -- Step 3: Interpretation

- Correlation measures /linear/ association
- Correlations are between $-1$ and $1$

* Calculating correlations -- Step 3: Interpretation
#+begin_src R :eval no
cor(log(data$GDP),data$Child.Mortality, use = "pairwise")
#+end_src

* Calculating correlations -- Step 3: Interpretation
