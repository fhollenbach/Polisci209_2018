* Conditional Probability

Sometimes information about one event can help inform us about likelihood of another event

Examples?

#+BEAMER: \pause

- What is the probability of rolling a 5 and then a 6?

- What is the probability of rolling a 5 and then a 6 given that we rolled a 5 first?

* Conditional Probability

If it is cloudy outside, gives us additional information about likelihood of rain

If we know that one party will win the House, makes it more likely that party will win certain Senate races

* Independence

If the occurrence of one event (A) gives us information about likelihood of another event, then the two events are *not* independent.

#+BEAMER: \pause

*Independence* of two events implies that information about one event does not help us in knowing whether the second event will occur.

* Independence

For many real world examples, independence does not hold

Knowledge about other events allows us to improve guesses/probability calculations

* Independence

When two events are independence, the probability of both happening is equal to the individual probabilities multiplied together


* Conditional Probability

P(A | B)

/Probability of A given/conditional that B has happened/

* Conditional Probability

  P(A | B) = $\frac{P(A and B)}{P(B)}$


/Probability of A and B happening (joint)  divided by probability of B happening (marginal)/

* Conditional Probability

Definitions:

P(A and B) - joint probability

P(A) - marginal probability


* Conditional Probability

P(rolled 5 then 6) = ?

#+BEAMER: \pause

P(rolled 5 then 6) = $\frac{1}{36}$

P(rolled 5 then 6 | 5 first) =  $\frac{P(5 then 6)}{P(5)}$

#+BEAMER: \pause


$\frac{\frac{1}{36}}{\frac{1}{6}} = \frac{1}{6}$


* Conditional Probability

The probability that it is Friday and that a student is absent is 0.03. What is the probability that student is absent, given that it is Friday?

P(absent | Friday) = ?

#+BEAMER: \pause

P(absent | Friday) = $\frac{0.03}{0.2} = 0.15$


* Conditional Probability


P(A | B) = $\frac{P(A and B)}{P(B)}$


Also means:

P(A and B) = P(A | B) P(B)

* Independence

If A and B are independent, then

         - P(A | B) = P(A) &  P(B | A) = P(B)

         - P(A and B) = P(A) $\times$ P(B)

* Independence

If A|C and B|C are independent, then

- P(A and B | C) = P(A |C) $\times$ P(B | C)



* Probability Problems

What is the probability of drawing any card between 2 and
10, or jack, queen, king in any color?


* Probability Problems

What is the probability of drawing two kings from a full deck of cards?

#+BEAMER: \pause

P(2 kings) = $\frac{4}{52} \times$?

#+BEAMER: \pause

P(2 kings) = $\frac{4}{52} \times \frac{3}{51} = \frac{12}{2652} =\frac{1}{221}$

* Bayes' Rule/Theorem

How should we update our beliefs about event A after learning about some data related to the event?

#+BEAMER: \pause

Example: What is the probability of a person developing lung cancer?
#+BEAMER: \pause

How does the probability change once we learn about the person's smoking habits?

* Bayes Rule/Theorem

P(A | B) = $\frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^{c})P(A^{c})}$


* Bayes Rule/Theorem

- Does your doctor know Bayes' rule? Cause he/she should!
- Example of medical tests:

  - every test comes with a reliability/accuracy
  - remember: false positive, false negative, etc

* Bayes Rule/Theorem

What is the probability of being pregnant, given that you have a positive test?

P(p | + ) = $\frac{P( + | p) P(p)}{P(+)}$

#+BEAMER: \pause

Decompose P(+), say test is 99 % accurate

* Bayes Rule/Theorem

What is the probability of being pregnant, given that you have a positive test?

P(preg | + ) = $\frac{P( + | p) P(p)}{P(+)} = \frac{P( + | p) P(p)}{P( + | p)P(p) + P( + | \text{not p})P(\text{not p})}$

* Bayes Rule/Theorem

What is the probability of being pregnant, given that you have a positive test?

P(p | +) = $\frac{P( + | p) P(p)}{P( + | p)P(p) + P( + | \text{not p})P(\text{not p})}$

#+BEAMER: \pause

P(p | +) = $\frac{0.99 P(p)}{ 0.99 P(p) + 0.05 P(\text{not p})}$

#+BEAMER: \pause

P(p | +) = $\frac{0.99 P(p)}{ 0.99 P(p) + 0.05 P(\text{not p})}$

* Random Variables and Probability Distributions

- What is a random variable? We assigns a number to an event
     - coin flip: tail= 0; heads= 1
     - Senate election: Ted Cruz= 0; Beto O'Rourke= 1
     - Voting: vote = 1; not vote = 0



#+BEAMER: \pause

Probability distribution: Probability of an event that a random variable takes a certain value


* Random Variables and Probability Distributions

- P(coin =1); P(coin = 0)
- P(election = 1); P(election = 0)


* Random Variables and Probability Distributions

- *Probability density function (PDF)*: f(x) How likely does X take a particular value?
- *Probability mass function (PMF)*: When X is discrete, f(x)=P(X =x)

#+BEAMER: \pause

- *Cumulative distribution function (CDF)*: F(x) = P(X $\leq$ x)
       - What is the probability that a random variable X takes a value equal to or less than x?
       - Area under the density curve (either we use the sum $\Sigma$ or integral $\int$)
       - Non-decreasing


* Random Variables and Probability Distributions: Binomial Distribution

- *PMF*: for $x \in \{0, 1, \dots, n\}$,
    $f(x) \ = \ P(X = x) \ = \ {n \choose x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$

- *CDF*: for $x \in \{0, 1, \dots, n\}$
    $F(x) \ = \ P(X \le x) \ = \ \sum_{k = 0}^x {n\choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$



* Random Variables and Probability Distributions: Binomial Distribution

- Example: flip a fair coin 3 times

    $f(x) \ = \ P(X = x) \ = \ {n \choose x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$

    $f(x) \ = \ P(X = 1) \ = \ {3 \choose 1} 0.5^1 (0.5)^{2} = 3*0.5*0.5^2 = 0.375$
