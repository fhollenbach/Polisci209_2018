* Statistical Inference

Goal: trying to estimate something unobservable from observable data

What we want to estimate: *parameter* $\theta$ $\rightsquigarrow$ unobservable

What you do observe: *data*

#+BEAMER: \pause

We use data to compute an estimate of the parameter $\hat\theta$


* Parameters and Estimators

- *parameter*: the quantity that we are interested in

#+BEAMER: \pause

- *estimator*: method to compute parameter of interest

* Parameters and Estimators

Example:

- *parameter*: support for Jimbo Fisher in student population

- *estimator*: sample proportion of support as estimator

* Parameters and Estimators

Example:

- *parameter*: average causal effect of aspirin on headache

- *estimator*: difference in mean between treatment and control


* Quality of estimators

For the rest of the semester the question becomes:

*How good is our estimator?*

#+BEAMER: \pause

1. *How close in expectation is the estimator to the truth?*

2. *How certain or uncertain are we about the estimate?*

* Quality of estimators

How good is $\hat\theta$ as an estimate of $\theta$?

- Ideally, we want to know *estimation error* $= \hat\theta - \theta_{truth}$

But we can never calculate this. Why?

#+BEAMER: \pause

$\theta_{truth}$ is unknown

 /If we knew what the truth was, we didn't need an estimate/

* Quality of estimators

Instead, we consider two hypothetical scenarios:
  1. How well would $\hat\theta$ perform over /repeated data generating processes/? (*bias*)
  2. How well would $\hat\theta$ perform as the sample size goes to infinity? (*consistency*)

* Bias

- Imagine the estimate being a random variable itself

- Drawing infinitely many samples of students asking about Jimbo

What is the average of the sample average? Or what is the expectation of the estimator?

bias = $\E$(estimation error) = $\E$(estimate - truth) = $\E(\bar{X})$ - p = p - p = 0


* Bias - *Important*

*An unbiased estimator does not mean that it is always exactly correct!*

#+BEAMER: \pause
*To remember:* bias measures whether in expectation (on average) the estimator is giving us the truth

* Consistency

Essentially saying that the law of large numbers applies to the estimator, i.e.:

*An estimator is said to be consistent if it converges to the parameter (truth) if N goes to $\infty$*


* Variability

Next, we have to consider how certain we are about our results

Consider two estimators:

1. slightly /biased/, on average off by a bit, but always by the same margin

2. unbiased, but misses target left and right


* Variability

(Encyclopedia of Machine Learning)

* Variability

We characterize the variability of an estimator by using the standard deviation of the sampling distribution

*How do we find that????*

#+BEAMER: \pause

Remember, the sampling distribution is the distribution of our statistic over hypothetical infinitely many samples

* Variability

* Standard Error

We estimate the standard deviation of the sampling distribution from the observed data

 *standard error*

#+BEAMER: \pause

"/standard error/ and describes the (estimated) average degree to which an estimator deviates from its expected value" (Imai 2017)

* Polling Example

Say we took a sample of 1000 students and asked whether they support Jimbo or not

Define a random variable $X_{i} = 1$ if student /i/ supports Jimbo, $X_{i}=0$ if not

Binomial distribution with success probability p and size N where p is the proportion of /all students/ who support Jimbo (population dist)


* Polling Example

Estimator: ?

* Polling Example

Estimator: $\overline{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i}$

#+BEAMER: \pause

In earlier notation: $\theta_{truth} =p$ and $\theta = \overline{X}$


* Polling Example

Estimator: $\overline{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i}$

1. LLN: $\overline{X} \longrightarrow p$ (*consistent*)

2. Expectation: $\E(\overline{X}) = p$ (*unbiased*)

3. standard error?


* Polling Example - standard error

$X_i$ are i.i.d Bernoulli random variables with probability = p


$\V(\overline{X}) = \frac{1}{N^{2}} \V(\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_{i})  = \frac{1}{N^{2}} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \V(X_{i})$


* Polling Example - standard error

$X_i$ are i.i.d Bernoulli random variables with probability = p


$\V(\overline{X}) = \frac{1}{N^{2}} \V(\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_{i})  = \frac{1}{N^{2}} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \V(X_{i}) = \frac{N}{N^{2}} \V(X)$


* Polling Example - standard error

$X_i$ are i.i.d Bernoulli random variables with probability = p


$\V(\overline{X}) = \frac{1}{N^{2}} \V(\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_{i})  = \frac{1}{N^{2}} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \V(X_{i}) = \frac{N}{N^{2}} \V(X) = \frac{p \times (1-p)}{N}$

* Polling Example - standard error

$\V(\overline{X}) = \frac{p \times (1-p)}{N}$

Standard error: $\sqrt{\V(\overline{X})}$

But we don't know p! Now what?

#+BEAMER: \pause

We use our unbiased estimate of p: \overline{X}

* Polling Example - standard error estimate

$\sqrt{\widehat{\V(\overline{X})}} = \sqrt{\frac{\overline{X}(1-\overline{X})}{N}}$

* Polling Example - standard error estimate

Assume in our sample 55% of students support Jimbo:

SE = $\sqrt{\widehat{\V(\overline{X})}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.55 \times (1-0.55)}{1500}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.55 \times (0.45)}{1000}} = 0.016$

We can expect our estimate on average to be off by 1.6 percentage points

#+BEAMER: \pause

If $\overline{X}$ = 0.8, then SE = 0.012

If N = 500, $\overline{X}$ = 0.55, then SE = 0.022

* Standard error estimate

Standard error is based on variance of the sampling distribution

Gives estimate of uncertainty

Each estimator/statistic has unique sampling distribution, e.g. difference in means

* Confidence Intervals
