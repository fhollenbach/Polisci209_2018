* Why probability?

- *Probability rules our lives*

- It is everywhere!

* Why probability?

- Humans are really bad at interpreting probabilities

- Even worse at calculating (estimating) probabilities

* Why probability?

* Why probability?

- What are the chances it rains tomorrow?

#+BEAMER: \pause

- What are the chances you win the lottery?

#+BEAMER: \pause

- What is the probabilty of getting an A in pols 209?

* Why probability?

- We use probability to express and calculate uncertainty

- /Preview/: later we will use probability to make statements about the uncertainty in our data analysis

* Two fundamental concepts of probability

- Frequentist: long-run frequency of events
  - *ratio between the number of times the event occurs and the number of trials*
  - example: coin flips

#+BEAMER: \pause

- Bayesian: belief about the likelihood of event occurrence
  - evidence based belief
  - often more sensible philosophy in political world

* Important Terms

1. *Experiment*: an action or a set of actions that produce stochastic events of interest

#+BEAMER: \pause

2. *sample space*: a set of all possible outcomes of the experiment, typically denoted by \Omega

#+BEAMER: \pause

3. *event*: a subset of the sample space

(Imai - QSS)

* Example

What is the experiment, sample space, and one event for coin flips or pulling a single card out of a deck of 52?

* Defining Probability

Probability of event A = P(A) = $\frac{\text{number of elements in A}}{\text{number of elements in sample space}}$

#+BEAMER: \pause

Probability of Head = P(H) = $\frac{1}{2}$


* Example

What is the probability of 3 head in 3 flips?

Sample space?

#+BEAMER: \pause

\Omega = {HHH,HHT,HTH,THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}

#+BEAMER: \pause

What is the event space we are interested in?

#+BEAMER: \pause

{HHH}

* Example

What is the probability of 3 head in 3 flips?


#+BEAMER: \pause

P(HHH) = $\frac{1}{8}$


* Example

What is the probability of 2 head in 3 flips?

\Omega = {HHH,HHT,HTH,THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}

What is the event space we are interested in?

#+BEAMER: \pause

{HHT, HTH, THH}

#+BEAMER: \pause

P(2 H) = $\frac{3}{8}$

* Axioms (rules) of Probability

- the probability of *any* event A is at least 0
  - P(A) $\geq$ 0

#+BEAMER: \pause

- The total sum of all possible outcomes in the sample space must be 1
  - P(\Omega) = 1

#+BEAMER: \pause

- If A and B are mutually exclusive (*meaning only one or the other can happen*), then P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)


* Axioms (rules) of Probability

A^{c} - complement to A, i.e. part of sample space not in A

Sometimes it is easier to calculate the probability of an event by using its complement



* Using the complement:

What is the probability of having at least one Tail on three coin flips?

\Omega = {HHH,HHT,HTH,THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}

#+BEAMER: \pause

P(at least one T) = $\frac{7}{8}$

P(at least one T) = 1 - P(HHH) = 1 - $\frac{1}{8}$



* Example of simple probability

What is the probability of getting a Queen as the first card from a full deck?

\Omega = {?}

Event space = {?}


#+BEAMER: \pause

p(Queen) = $\frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}$




* How to quickly count the sample space when order matters: permutations

- Often we do not want to or can't write out all possible combinations by hand

- How many possibilities are there to arrange letters A,B,C?

#+BEAMER: \pause

Three outcomes: A, B, C & three draws

#+BEAMER: \pause
First draw: A,B, or C

Second draw: two possibilities

Third draw: one left

3 x 2 x 1 possibilities

* How to quickly count the sample space when order matters: permutations

Permutations count many ways we can *order* k objects out of a set of n unique objects

$_{n}P_{k} = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times ... \times (n-k + 1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$

What does n! stand for?

#+BEAMER: \pause

n! = n-factorial = $n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times ... \times (n-n+1)$

$3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1$

*Note: 0! = 1*


* Permutation Example:

How many ways can we arrange four cards out of a the 13 spades in our card deck?

first draw: ?
#+BEAMER: \pause

13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10

#+BEAMER: \pause

$\frac{13!}{(13-4)!} = \frac{13!}{9!} = \frac{13 \times 12 \times 11 \times ... \times 2 \times 1}{9 \times 8 \times ... \times 2 \times 1} = 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 = 17,160k$

* Birthday Problem

Impress your family over Thanksgiving!

#+BEAMER: \pause

What is the probability that at least two people in this room have the same birthday?

How could we figure that out?

* Birthday Problem

Can the law of total probabilities and complement help us?

#+BEAMER: \pause

Yes, P(at least two share bday) = 1 - P(nobody shares bday)

* Birthday Problem

 P(nobody shares bday)?

What is the event space?

#+BEAMER: \pause

Event space:  everyone has a unique birthday. How many different possibilities?

#+BEAMER: \pause

How many possibilities for birthdays in a year?

#+BEAMER: \pause

365

#+BEAMER: \pause

How many unique arrangements would we need for nobody to share the birthday?

/number of people in room - k/

* Birthday Problem

1. $_{365}P_{k} = \frac{365!}{(365-k)!}$ possibilities to arrange k unique birthdays over 365 days

2. What is the sample space? *All the different possibilities for k birthdays (even non-unique).*

#+BEAMER: \pause
$365^{k}$

* Birthday Problem

P(at least two share bday) = 1 - P(nobody shares bday) = 1 - $\frac{365!}{(365-k)! \times 365^{k}}$

#+BEAMER: \pause

P(at least two share bday):

k = 10; 0.116,

k = 23; 0.504,

and k = 68; 0.999.


* Combinations

Combinations are similar to permutations, except that the ordering doesn't matter

So with respect to combinations of 3 out of 26 letters, ABC, BAC, CAB, etc are the same

#+BEAMER: \pause

There are *always* fewer combinations than permutations

* Combinations vs. Permutations

Draw 2 out of letters ABC

Permutations:
#+BEAMER: \pause

AB, AC, BA, BC, CA, CB =  $\frac{3!}{1!}$

Combinations:

#+BEAMER: \pause

AB, AC, BC

* How to Calculate Combinations

Calculate permutations and then account for the fact that we overcounted due to ordering

Get rid of counts of different arrangements of same combination: divide by k!

$_{n}C_{k} = {n \choose k} = \frac{_{n}P_{k}}{k!} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$


#+BEAMER: \pause
Why divide by k! ?

#+BEAMER: \pause
for two sampled elements, we have 2!(= 2Ã—1 = 2): A, B = AB, BA


* Lottery

What is the probability of winning (simplified) Mega Millions?

Pick five numbers between 1 and 70

Probability of getting 5 correct?


* Lottery

Probability of getting 5 correct?

What is the size of the event space?

#+BEAMER: \pause

1 ticket


* Lottery

Pick five numbers between 1 and 70

Sample space?

#+BEAMER: \pause

${70 \choose 5} = \frac{70!}{5! \times (70-5)!} =  \frac{70!}{5! \times 65!}$


#+BEAMER: \pause

 12,103,014

* Lottery

${n \choose k}$ in /R/

choose(n,k)

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :session
choose(70,5)
#+end_src



* Samping /with/ and /without/ Replacement

Two ways to sample (draw) data:

     - with replacement: put draw back in box

     - without replacement: keep draw, ticket can *not* be drawn again

#+BEAMER: \pause
If we are sampling for a survey, what technique do we use?


* Simulating the birthday problem in /R/

- Instead of calculating probabilities, we can often simulate them in /R/

- Use /R/ to draw k birthdays and see whether any duplicates exist

#+BEAMER: \pause

- We repeat the experiment over and over (~ 1000 times). The share of experiments in which we found duplicates, will represent P(at least one shared bday)

* Simulating the birthday problem in /R/

#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :session
k <- 23 # number of people
sims <- 1000 # number of simulations
event <- 0 # counter
for (i in 1:sims) {
    days <- sample(1:365, k, replace = TRUE)
    days.unique <- unique(days) # unique birthdays
    if (length(days.unique) < k) {
        event <- event + 1 } }
event / sims
#+end_src



* Simulating the birthday problem in /R/

The larger the number of simulation iterations, the better the accuracy
#+begin_src R :results output :exports both :session
sims <- 10000 # number of simulations
event <- 0 # counter
for (i in 1:sims) {
    days <- sample(1:365, k, replace = TRUE)
    days.unique <- unique(days) # unique birthdays
    if (length(days.unique) < k) {
        event <- event + 1  }}
event / sims
#+end_src
