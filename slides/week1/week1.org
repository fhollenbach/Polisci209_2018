* What is this class about?

"Two transformative technological changes have driven this rapid growth of quantitative social science. First, the Internet has greatly facilitated data revolution, a spike in the amount and diversity of available data, through information sharing, making it possible for researchers and organizations to disseminate numerous data sets in digital form. Second, the computational revolution, in terms of both software and hardware, means that essentially anyone can conduct data analysis using their personal computer and favorite data analysis software without needing to access expensive computational facilities." -- Kosuke Imai
