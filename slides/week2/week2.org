* Causal Inference

** What do you think is causal inference?

* Causal Inference

- causal: relationship between things where one causes the other
- inference: to derive as a conclusion from facts or premises

Causal inference is the __attempt__ to derive causal connection based on the conditions of the occurrence of an effect

* Causal Inference

- Most questions that empirical (political) scientist are interested in are causal questions

* Causal Inference

Do you think one of these questions is harder to answer than the others?

* Causal Inference

Think of the causal effect as the difference between what happened and what could have happened with/without a “/treatment/” (or change in X)

/How do we measure the causal effect?/

* Is there a causal effect of democracy on child mortality?

* How would you know if two variables are causally related?

\LARGE{X $\rightarrow$ Y ?}

#+BEAMER: \pause
\LARGE{T $\rightarrow$ Y ?}


* How would you know if two variables are causally related?

#+BEAMER: \pause
- they occurr together?
- if X goes up, Y goes up
- if X happens, Y happens
- if T, then change in Y


#+BEAMER: \pause
If two things happen together a lot, we say they are correlated

* Is correlation sufficient for causation?

#+BEAMER: \pause
\LARGE{NO}

* Causal Inference - Concepts

- Key causal variable: /Treatment (T)/
- Two /potential outcomes/: Y with T = 0 and Y with T = 1

#+BEAMER: \pause
Example:
- /Treatment/: getting BS in political science instead of BA
- /potential outcomes/: Salary after getting BS (Y (T = 1)) or after BA (Y (T = 0))


* Why is causal inference so hard?

- The causal effect of a /treatment/ is the difference in the /outcome/ with and without the treatment:
  Y(T = 1) - Y(T = 0) \rightarrow Y(1) - Y(0)

#+BEAMER: \pause
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 10cm
[[~/Documents/GitHub/Polisci209_2018/slides/week2/causaleffect.png]]

- Why might this be a problem?

* Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

We never observe the /counterfactual/, i.e. the outcome if the /treatment condition/ was different

#+BEAMER: \pause
Example:
- /Treatment/: getting BS in political science instead of BA
- /Potential outcomes/: Salary after getting BS (Y (T = 1)) or after BA (Y (T = 0))
- For each of you we only observe one outcome


* Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

Examples:

- We don't observe Kuwait as a democracy
- You don't know how you would feel if you didn't drink that coffee
- We don't know how the world/US would look if Clinton had won the election

* How can we estimate the causal effect?

- We try to estimate the /average causal effect/ in our sample (SATE) by comparing groups
- In our sample, does the /Treatment/ on average cause a change in /Y/?
#+BEAMER: \pause
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 10cm
[[~/Documents/GitHub/Polisci209_2018/slides/week2/sate.png]]
But again we only observe one outcome per person!

* How can we find the causal effect?

Solution: We compare the average of those who received the treatment (/treated group/) to the average of those who did not (/control group/)
#+BEAMER: \pause


Is this enough?

#+BEAMER: \pause
Are the two groups comparable?


* Experiments/Randomized Control Trials

- In /Randomized Control Trials/ the researcher assigns /treatment/ and /control/ group status
#+BEAMER: \pause
- By randomizing the assignment, we guarantee that the two groups are comparable in all other dimensions
- The random assignment /balances/ out treatment and control group

* Experiments/Randomized Control Trials

\Large{Internal validity vs external validity}


* Experiments/Randomized Control Trials

- People may behave differently because they are observed (/Hawthorne effect/)
- People may behave differently because they expect the /treatment/ to work (/placebo effect/)
