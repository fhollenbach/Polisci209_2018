* Review

** What is the fundamental problem of causal inference?

* Review

** What about randomized control trials allows us to credibly estimate a causal effect?

* Get out the Vote Study

** What can induce citizens to vote?

* What was the experiment?

#+BEAMER: \pause
Letters to randomized households with treatment:
1. Naming and Shaming: your neighbors will know
2. Civic Duty
3. Hawthorne Effect Message
4. Control (no letter)

* Let's go to R-studio quick


* Observational Studies and Causal Inference

** What is the main problem for observational studies?

#+BEAMER: \pause
   - Confounders: variables that are associated with both treatment and outcome

* What is the Problem with Confounders?

#+BEAMER: \pause

- If pre-treatment characteristics are associated with treatment and outcome, we can't disentangle causal effect from confounding bias

#+BEAMER: \pause

- Selection into treament example: Maybe minimum wage was increased because unemployment was particularly low in NJ, but not PA

* Examples of Confounding

- Are incumbents more likely to win elections? Yes, but...

#+BEAMER: \pause

   - Incumbents receive more campaign contributions
   - Incumbents have more staff

*  Examples of Confounding

- Does higher income lead countries to democratize?

#+BEAMER: \pause

   - Higher income countries have more educated populations



* What can we do about confounding in observational studies?

#+BEAMER: \pause

- Make /Treatment/ and /Control/ groups as similar to each other as possible
- Especially on variables that might matter for treatment status and outcome
- Analyze subsets or /statistical control/, such that we compare treated and control units that have same value on confounder

* Another problem with observational studies:
  - Reverse causality

#+BEAMER: \pause

  - Example: Does economic growth cause democratization or democratization cause growth?

Why do experiments not suffer from the threat of reverse causality?

* Observational studies

Difference-in-Differences Design

* Difference-in-Differences Design

- Compare trends before and after the treatment across the same units
- Takes initial conditions into account

* Difference-in-Differences Design

- Need data measured for both treatment and control at two different time periods: before and after treatment

- Total difference between P2 and S2 can not be attributed to treatment. Why?

* Difference-in-Differences Design

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 4cm

What might be a necessary condition for Diff-in-Diff to work?

* Describing numeric variables:

- Mean
- Median
- Quantiles


* Quantiles

  - splitting observations into equaly size groups, e.g., quartiles, quantiles
  - 75th percentile is the threshold under which 75% of observations lie
  - What percentile is the median?


* Describing the spread of numeric variables:

- IQR:

#+BEAMER: \pause

     Difference between 75th percentile and 25th percentile

* Describing the spread of numeric variables:

Standard Deviation

#+BEAMER: \pause


SD = $\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum^{N}_{i = 1} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}}$

* Standard Deviation

* Describing single Variables

- Barplots can be used to summarize factor(?) variables
- Proportion of observations in each category as the height of each bar

* Barplots

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[~/Documents/GitHub/Polisci209_2018/slides/week3/barplot.png]]


* Histograms

- Histograms look similar to barplots
- Used for numeric variables
- Numeric variables are /binned/ into groups

* Histograms

- Each bar is for one bin
- Height of each bar is the /density/ of the bin

#+BEAMER: \pause

- Important: Height is share of observations in bin divided by bin size

#+BEAMER: \pause

- Unit of vertical axis (y-axis) is interpreted as percentage per horizontal (x-axis) unit

* Histograms

- Area of each bar is the share of observations that fall into that bin
- Area of all bins sum to one

* Histograms

* Boxplots

- Boxplots also display the distribution of a numeric variable
- Boxplots show the /median/, /quartiles/, and /IQR/

* Boxplots

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[~/Documents/GitHub/Polisci209_2018/slides/week3/boxplot.png]]


* Boxplots can show how two variables covary

* Survey Sampling

- A sample is a small share of the population in that we are interested in

#+BEAMER: \pause

- How do we draw samples in such a way that polls accurately reflect what is going to happen?

- How to construct samples that will represent the population?

* Survey Sampling

- Example: We want to know the voting intentions of Texans (or Americans)
- We can hardly ask all eligible voters about their intention

#+BEAMER: \pause
- We take a /sample/

* Survey Sampling

- The size of the sample is less important than its composition

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[~/Documents/GitHub/Polisci209_2018/slides/week3/drudge.jpeg]]

- Never trust an internet poll

* Literary Digest Sample

- Mail questionnaire to 10 million people

- Addresses came from phone books and club memberships

- Problems?

#+BEAMER: \pause

- Biased /sample/


* Quota Samping

- Sample certain groups until quota is filled

- Does not mean unobservables are representative

* Simple Random Sampling

- Think of all voters sitting in a box, survey firm randomly draws voters

- Random draws without replacement give us an unbiased estimate of the population

- Everybody has the same chance of being in the sample


* Simple Random Sampling

- Pre-determined number of units are randomly selected from population

- Sample will be representative of population on observed and unobserved characteristics



* Simple Random Sampling

- Not every single sample will be exactly representative

- If we were to take a lot of random samples (say 1000 samples of 1000 respondents), on average the samples would be representative

* Simple Random Sampling

- Each single sample can be off and different

- Polls are associated with uncertainty

* Random Sampling is hard

- How to create sampling frame?

- Random digit dialing? Walking to random houses?

- Multi-stage cluster sampling

* Non-reponse bias

- Unit non-response bias:

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 8cm
[[~/Documents/GitHub/Polisci209_2018/slides/week3/cohn.png]]




* Non-reponse bias

- Item non-response bias:
   /What was the last crime you committed?/
- Sensitive questions: non-response, social desirability bias
  /Turnout/, /racial prejudice/, /corruption/


* Why could this be a problem in the Afghanistan example?
